                    <p>It wasn't quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the situation. 
                    At least that is what she was telling himself. The reality was that it was time to panic 
                    and there wasn't time to salvage the situation, 
                    but he continued to delude himself into believing there was.

                He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. 
                The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. 
                Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.

                    She was aware that things could go wrong. In fact, she had trained her entire life in anticipation that things would go wrong one day.
                    She had quiet confidence as she started to see that this was the day that all her training would be worthwhile 
                    and useful. At this point, she had no idea just how wrong everything would go that day.

                The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. 
                Dave knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness.
                Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't.

                The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, 
                at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating.
                Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing.

                <p>
                She was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace, but a frantic hurry. The type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. 
                She raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.

                    <p> She had a terrible habit of comparing her life to others. She realized that their life experiences were completely different
                        than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to see, but that didn't matter.
                        She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they had and she didn't.
